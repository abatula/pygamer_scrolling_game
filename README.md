# PyGamer/PyBadge Tutorial: World Exploration With Blinka

Making a game for the PyGamer/PyBadge in Python! Some next steps after finishing [Adafruit's Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library/overview).


Maybe someday I'll make this into a tutorial. But for now, I tried to comment the code. Here are some resources and tips I had to learn the hard way:

- [Stage library documentation](https://circuitpython-stage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html)
- Blinka sprite modified from Adafruit [sprite sheet](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-display-support-using-displayio/sprite-sheet)
- The hex color that renders as transparent is FF00FF
- Remember to save off the device all the time! The device corrupts easily if disconnected improperly from the computer, and even small jostles seem to set it off.
